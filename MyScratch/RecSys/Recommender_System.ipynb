    "## Benefits of DL recommender systems\n",
    "There are many different techniques to desin a recommender system, e.g.\n",
    "- Association rules\n",
    "- Content- or Context-based/ Memory- or Model-based\n",
    "- Collaborative filtering\n",
    "- Matrix factorization\n",
    "- training a linear or tree-based model to predict the interaction likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "### So why Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",

    "### Architecture of DL based Recommender System\n",
    "#### Basic building block: Embedding layers\n",
    "- Embedding layers represent categories with dense vectors.\n",
    "  - NLP: embed words with dense representation. \n",
    "  - words with similar meaning have a similar embedding vector.\n",
    "- Similarly, the most trivial RS is based on users and items\n",
    "  - User IDS, item IDS. Words are users and items. and build two embedding tables.\n",
    "  - calculate the dot prod between the user and the item embedding to get the likelihood that a user interacts with an item.\n",
    "  - Activation function to transform the output to a probability.\n",
    "  - This is equiv to matrix factorization or alternating least squares(ALS).\n",
